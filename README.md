### 🧹 Code Smell Detection  
[![Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Repo-blue?logo=github)](https://github.com/rohansood98/code_smell_detection)

Detects software code smells using ML and pretrained code embeddings.  
- 📊 Focused on **"Data Class"** and **"Feature Envy"** smells from the [MLCQ dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/3630805)  
- 🧠 Used models: `plbart_base`, `cubert`, `codeT5_base`, `codeT5_small`, `codebert-base`  
- 🔍 Aggregated embeddings, code metrics (CK tool), and applied ML models:  
  - Random Forest  
  - Bagging  
  - XGBoost  
  - SVM  
- 📁 Dataset setup and feature extraction done per smell category  
- ❗ Feature Envy metrics were limited due to short code segments
